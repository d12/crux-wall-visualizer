# Climbing Wall Visualizer

A web application for visualizing climbing walls and managing hold mappings. This tool allows you to view climbing walls from your Crux gyms and create mappings between hold IDs and external IDs.

Shamelessly vibe-coded in ~30 minutes. Thanks Cursor ðŸ«¡

## Features

- View climbing walls from your Crux gyms
- Interactive hold selection and highlighting
- External ID management for holds
- JSON mapping export functionality

## Getting Started

1. Get your Crux API key:
   - Open the Crux app
   - Go to Profile -> Settings -> API Authentication
   - Copy the API key

2. Open the application in your web browser
   - Enter your API key
   - Select a gym from your viewed gyms
   - Select a wall to visualize

## Usage

1. **Selecting Holds**
   - Click on a hold to select it

   - The smallest hold is selected when multiple holds overlap

2. **Managing External IDs**
   - Click a hold to select it
   - Enter an external ID in the input field
   - Click "Save" to store the mapping
   - Holds with external IDs are highlighted in purple

   - Click "Copy Mapping" to copy the JSON to your clipboard
